# Minecraft-Recipe-Randomizer
Scrambles the output of a folder full of Minecraft recipes

NOTE: 'recipes' folder in each difficulty contains the default minecraft recipes that can change, recipes in main directory is a sample

Protects against impossible seeds- also adjustable difficulty now!


INSTRUCTIONS:
- Run the Rust script
- Add back in the removed recipes from the add_in directory of the selected difficulty
- Take the revised Recipes folder and use it to replace the Recipes folder in the included datapack-base
- Put a copy of the datapack-base folder in your datapacks folder, enable it in-game, and disable the vanilla resource pack
